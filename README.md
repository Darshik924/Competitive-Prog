### Tips for Practicing 

- When solving problems, remember that *quality* of the problem matters more than the *number* of problems you have solved.

- Many Problems can be solved using simple and short algorithms, difficult part is to *think* of these algorithms. This is about learning problem solving and ways to approach a difficult problem using simple tools than learning complex algorithms by heart

- The ability to quickly and correcctly implement algorithms is important. It is a bad idea to spend most of contest time in writing code and finding bugs rather than thinking of how to solve the problem.
